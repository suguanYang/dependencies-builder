When starting work on a Next.js project, ALWAYS call the `init` tool from
next-devtools-mcp FIRST to set up proper context and establish documentation
requirements. Do this automatically without being asked.


Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

Always use firecrawl when we need to read content from web page

Always using pnpm to manage project

Do not run the project unless the user told you to run
